## 🔧 New Architecture

### **Token Management**
- **Before**: Redux store managed auth tokens
- **After**: localStorage-based token management with `tokenUtils` helper

### **State Management**
- **Before**: Centralized Redux store
- **After**: Local component state with custom events for cross-component communication

### **API Communication**
- **Before**: Redux actions dispatched to store
- **After**: Direct API calls with localStorage token management

### **Component Communication**
- **Before**: Redux store subscriptions
- **After**: Custom DOM events (`auth:logout`, `auth:login`, `cart:updated`)

## 📁 Files That Were Removed
- ❌ `src/store/` directory (if it existed)
- ❌ All Redux slice files
- ❌ Redux store configuration

## 🚀 Benefits of Redux Removal

1. **Simplified Architecture**: No more complex state management
2. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed Redux dependencies
3. **Easier Debugging**: Local state is easier to track
4. **Faster Development**: No need to configure Redux actions/reducers
5. **Better Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders from store subscriptions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Authentication Flow**
- Tokens are now stored in localStorage
- Components check authentication status on mount
- Custom events notify components of auth state changes

### **Cart Management**
- Cart operations now use direct API calls
- Custom events notify other components of cart updates
- No centralized cart state

### **Toast System**
- Toast component is now standalone
- Must be controlled via props or context
- No automatic toast management

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### **State Management Alternatives**
If you need more complex state management in the future, consider:
- **React Context API**: For simple global state
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **Jotai**: Atomic state management
- **React Query**: For server state management

### **Toast System Enhancement**
Consider implementing a toast context or manager for better toast handling across the app.

### **Authentication Enhancement**
Consider implementing a proper auth context for better authentication state management.

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure no Redux packages remain in `package.json`
2. **Test Authentication**: Verify login/logout functionality works
3. **Test Cart Operations**: Verify adding/removing items works
4. **Test Navigation**: Verify all routes work correctly
5. **Check Console**: Ensure no Redux-related errors

## 🎯 Summary

The Redux removal has been completed successfully! Your application now uses:
- **Local component state** for UI state
- **localStorage** for persistent data (tokens)
- **Custom events** for cross-component communication
- **Direct API calls** for data operations

The application maintains all its functionality while being simpler and more maintainable.
