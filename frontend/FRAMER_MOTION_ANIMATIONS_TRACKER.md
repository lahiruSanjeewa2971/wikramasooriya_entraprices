## üì¶ Dependencies Required

### Installation
```bash
npm install framer-motion
```

### Import Examples
```javascript
import { motion, AnimatePresence, useInView, useMediaQuery } from 'framer-motion';
import { useScroll, useTransform } from 'framer-motion';
```

### Products Page Animation Examples
```javascript
// Product card variants
const productCardVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20, scale: 0.95 },
  visible: { 
    opacity: 1, 
    y: 0, 
    scale: 1,
    transition: { duration: 0.3, ease: "easeOut" }
  },
  hover: { 
    y: -5, 
    scale: 1.02,
    transition: { duration: 0.2 }
  }
};

// Grid container variants
const gridVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1,
      delayChildren: 0.2
    }
  }
};

// Search results transition
const searchTransition = {
  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  animate: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
  exit: { opacity: 0, y: -20 },
  transition: { duration: 0.3 }
};
```

## üé® Animation Principles

### Performance Guidelines
- Use `transform` and `opacity` properties for smooth 60fps animations
- Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` properties
- Use `will-change` CSS property for elements that will be animated
- Implement `useReducedMotion` hook for accessibility

### Timing Guidelines
- **Micro-interactions**: 150-300ms
- **Page transitions**: 300-500ms
- **Complex animations**: 500-800ms
- **Staggered animations**: 100-200ms delay between items

### Easing Guidelines
- **Ease out**: For entrance animations
- **Ease in**: For exit animations
- **Ease in-out**: For state changes
- **Custom cubic-bezier**: For unique brand feel

## üîß Implementation Notes

### Component Structure
- Wrap animated elements with `motion.div`
- Use `variants` for complex animation sequences
- Implement `AnimatePresence` for mount/unmount animations
- Use `useInView` for scroll-triggered animations

### State Management
- Use `useState` for animation triggers
- Implement `useEffect` for scroll-based animations
- Consider `useRef` for direct DOM manipulation when needed

### Products Page Specific Notes
- **Grid Animations**: Use `layout` prop for smooth grid reflows
- **Search States**: Implement `AnimatePresence` for search result transitions
- **Loading States**: Use skeleton animations with `animate` prop
- **Cart Interactions**: Implement `whileTap` for button press feedback
- **Responsive**: Use `useMediaQuery` for responsive animation variants
- **Performance**: Implement `memo` for product cards to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## üì± Responsive Considerations

### Mobile Optimizations
- Reduce animation complexity on mobile devices
- Use `useReducedMotion` for users with motion sensitivity
- Test animations on various screen sizes
- Consider performance impact on lower-end devices

### Tablet/Desktop Enhancements
- Add more complex animations for larger screens
- Implement hover states for interactive elements
- Use parallax effects for desktop users
