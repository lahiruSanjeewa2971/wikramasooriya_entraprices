# Simple Database Setup - No Sequelize

## Overview
We've successfully removed Sequelize and replaced it with a simple, direct PostgreSQL connection using the `pg` client. This approach is much more straightforward and avoids the complex ORM issues we were experiencing.

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Database Setup ✅
- **Database**: `wik_db` created successfully
- **Tables**: All required tables created with proper structure
- **Indexes**: Performance indexes added for common queries
- **Relationships**: Foreign key constraints properly set up

### 2. Database Structure
```
Tables Created:
├── users (id, name, email, mobile, location, password_hash, role, is_active, last_login, created_at, updated_at)
├── categories (id, name, description, image_url, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
├── products (id, sku, name, description, price, category_id, image_url, stock_qty, featured, new_arrival, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
├── carts (id, user_id, status, total_amount, item_count, created_at, updated_at)
├── cart_items (id, cart_id, product_id, qty, price_at_add, subtotal, created_at, updated_at)
└── contacts (id, name, email, message, status, ip_address, user_agent, created_at, updated_at)
```

### 3. Sample Data ✅
- **5 Categories**: Bearings, Fasteners, Hydraulics, Electrical, Tools
- **6 Products**: Various industrial products with realistic data
- **2 Users**: Admin user and regular user
- **2 Carts**: One for each user

### 4. Simple Services Created ✅
- **`simpleProductService.js`**: Handles all product-related operations
  - Get all products with filtering, pagination, and sorting
  - Get product by ID
  - Get featured products
  - Get new arrivals
  - Get all categories

- **`simpleAuthService.js`**: Handles authentication
  - User registration
  - User login
  - JWT token generation and verification
  - User profile retrieval

### 5. Database Connection ✅
- **`simple-connection.js`**: Simple connection pool using `pg` client
- **Credentials**: Using postgres user with password `Abcd@1234`
- **Connection**: Stable and reliable connection to `wik_db`

## How to Use

### 1. Setup Database
```bash
# Create tables
node setup-simple-db.js

# Seed with sample data
node seed-simple-db.js
```

### 2. Use Services
```javascript
import { simpleProductService } from './src/services/simpleProductService.js';
import { simpleAuthService } from './src/services/simpleAuthService.js';

// Get all products
const products = await simpleProductService.getAllProducts();

// Login user
const loginResult = await simpleAuthService.login('admin@wikramasooriya.com', 'Admin123!');
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplicity**: No complex ORM, just direct SQL queries
2. **Performance**: Direct database access without ORM overhead
3. **Control**: Full control over SQL queries and database operations
4. **Debugging**: Easy to debug and understand what's happening
5. **Maintenance**: Simpler to maintain and modify

## Next Steps

1. **Update Controllers**: Replace Sequelize calls with simple service calls
2. **Add More Services**: Create cart, contact, and other services as needed
3. **Error Handling**: Add proper error handling and validation
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for all services

## Files to Keep
- `setup-simple-db.js` - Database table creation
- `seed-simple-db.js` - Database seeding
- `src/db/simple-connection.js` - Database connection
- `src/services/simpleProductService.js` - Product operations
- `src/services/simpleAuthService.js` - Authentication operations

## Files to Remove/Replace
- All Sequelize model files
- `src/db/connection.js` (Sequelize version)
- Any controllers using Sequelize models

This approach gives us a clean, simple, and reliable database foundation that's much easier to work with than Sequelize!
